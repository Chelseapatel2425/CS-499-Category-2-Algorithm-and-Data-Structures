The artifact: How much paint is needed?
Origin: IT-145
How much paint is needed to paint a wall was an artifact created in IT-145 Foundation in Application Development. This artifact allowed the user to find how much paint is needed to paint the wall. This algorithm was created for an assignment to find the amount of paint needed. The algorithm was created in java language. The algorithm accepted the wall height and the wall width to find the area of the wall. The calculation also displayed the gallons needed to paint the area of the wall. At the end of the program, I also used a ceil() function which rounds up and returns the smaller integer greater than or equal to a given number.

Choosing this artifact allows me to show my knowledge on algorithms and data structures. This artifact was first created using the java programming language. For the enhancement I proposed to recreate the same code to c++ and make it more user friendly and interactive. Changing the language from java to c++ would display my knowledge of high-level programming language. When enhancing the project I had to do a lot of problem solving, debugging the errors. This artifact involves validating input data and produce denial if the input of the user has not met the requirements. I created a code and performed the following: debug coding errors by testing existing code, identifying errors, and correcting errors for improved functionality. The program itself focuses on operators to complete an equation. Each line of code will be accompanied with comments, appropriate formatting, naming, and indentations, making the code easy to read by other developers, teammates, or even non-coding personals.

Yes, I have met all the course objective that I planned to meet through my enchantment plan. I have started this C++ program with a header file, #include , which was important for my ceil() function to work, this header file allows with math functions. I have two functions in the program: DisplayMenu() and main(). Display menu would allow the user to select from the following options. There are 4 choices: 1-find the area, 2-gallons needed, 3- how much would it cost? and 4-exit. Next the main() function starts with a while loop that executes until the user inputs 4 for quit service choice.
