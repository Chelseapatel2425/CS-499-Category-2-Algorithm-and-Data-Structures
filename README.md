The artifact: How much paint is needed?

How much paint is needed to paint a wall was an artifact created in IT-145 Foundation in Application Development. 
This artifact allowed the user to find how much paint is needed to paint the wall. This algorithm was created for 
an assignment to find the amount of paint needed. The algorithm was created in java language. The algorithm 
accepted the wall height and the wall width to find the area of the wall. The calculation also displayed the
gallons needed to paint the area of the wall. At the end of the program, I also used a ceil() function which 
rounds up and returns the smaller integer greater than or equal to a given number.

Choosing this artifact allows me to show my knowledge on algorithms and data strctures. This artifact was first
created using the java programming language. For the enhancement I proposed to recreate the same code to c++ and 
make it more user friendly and interactive. Changing the language from java to c++ would display my knowledge of 
high level programming language. When enhancening the project I had to do a lot of problem solving, debuging the
errors. This artifact involves validating input data and produce denial if the input of the user has not met the
requirements. I created a code and performed the following: debug coding errors by testing existing code, 
identifying errors, and correcting errors for improved functionality. The program itself focuses on operators to
complete an equation. Each line of code will be accompanied with comments, appropriate formatting, naming, and 
indentations, making the code easy to read by other developers, teammates, or even non-coding personals. 

Yes, I have met all the course objective that I planned to meet through my enchantment plan.
I have started this C++ program with a header file, #include <cmath>, which was important for my ceil() function to
work, this header file allows with math functions. I have two functions in the program: DisplayMenu() and main(). 
Display menu would allow the user to select from the following options. There are 4 choices: 1-find the area, 2-gallons needed, 
3- how much would it cost? and 4-exit. Next the main() function starts with a while loop that executes until the user inputs 
4 for quit servie choice.
